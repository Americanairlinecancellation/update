    <h1>United Airlines Flight Cancellation Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Travel plans are often subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances such as personal emergencies, weather disruptions, or schedule conflicts. Understanding the flight cancellation policy of a major carrier like United Airlines is essential for travelers who wish to minimize financial losses and stress when plans change. United Airlines offers a structured and flexible cancellation policy, with rules varying based on fare type, timing, and whether the cancellation is initiated by the passenger or the airline.
    </p>

    <h2>24-Hour Risk-Free Cancellation</h2>
    <p>
        At the core of United Airlines' cancellation policy is its 24-hour risk-free cancellation rule, which allows passengers to cancel any flight without penalty within 24 hours of booking, provided the ticket was purchased at least one week before the scheduled departure. This policy applies to all fare classes, including Basic Economy, and ensures that travelers have a grace period to reassess their plans. Refunds under this policy are processed to the original form of payment and do not incur any cancellation or processing fees.
    </p>

    <h2>Non-Refundable vs. Refundable Tickets</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond the 24-hour window, United Airlines differentiates between non-refundable and refundable tickets. Non-refundable tickets cannot be refunded in cash if canceled after the 24-hour grace period; however, United Airlines offers the option to cancel and retain the ticket’s value as a travel credit, which must be used within one year from the original date of issue. Fare differences may apply.
    </p>

    <p>
        Refundable tickets, while more expensive, provide full reimbursement if canceled anytime before departure. Refunds are processed within 7 business days for credit cards and 20 days for cash/check payments. Not all premium fares are refundable, so fare rules should be reviewed during booking.
    </p>

    <h2>Change Fee Elimination</h2>
    <p>
        United Airlines has eliminated change fees for domestic and select international flights on non-refundable Main Cabin, Premium Economy, Business, and First Class tickets. This policy provides added flexibility, though fare differences still apply. Basic Economy tickets remain excluded from this benefit.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Economy Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Basic Economy tickets typically cannot be changed or canceled for a refund or travel credit after the 24-hour grace period. These low-cost fares come with significant restrictions. However, exceptions may be granted during major travel disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.
    </p>

    <h2>Cancellation Channels</h2>
    <p>
        United Airlines provides several options for cancellations: through the official website, mobile app, or by calling customer service at <strong>1-833-845-1858</strong>. Third-party bookings must be canceled through the original provider, and their policies may differ.
    </p>

    <h2>Flight Cancellations by United Airlines</h2>
    <p>
        If United Airlines cancels a flight or makes a significant schedule change, passengers are entitled to a refund or rebooking. Compensation such as hotel accommodations and meal vouchers may be provided for overnight delays caused by the airline.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Credit System</h2>
    <p>
        When eligible, canceled flights result in a Travel Credit valid for 12 months. These credits can be redeemed online by entering the code during booking. Expired credits cannot be extended.
    </p>

    <h2>Travel Insurance Options</h2>
    <p>
        Travelers may purchase insurance through United or a third-party provider. Insurance covers cancellations due to illness, injury, or other covered events. Some credit cards also offer built-in travel protections.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        United Airlines’ cancellation policy balances flexibility and structure. The 24-hour grace period, eliminated change fees, and travel credit options offer convenience for most travelers. Understanding fare rules and using digital tools enhances the cancellation experience and helps travelers make informed decisions.
